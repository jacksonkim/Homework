		I made a necklace for my neice for Easter. I'll post that up eventually just to show it. I don't know if its a thing I want to sell on the regular.<br /><br />
		I also made a necklace based on a project my boyfriend and I are working on. It's a necklace that is supposed to be possessed by an evil spirit based on the Western Zodiac. I'll post that up in the product section later. It's pretty long, so I might have to work on shortening it.<br /><br />
		I have an idea for another Mass Effect Bracelet as well. This one with Cerberus colors. Once I get the Alliance colored one up, I'll work on that one.<br /><br />
		For those of you wondering why I haven't been working on earrings, it's not that I don't want to - because I desperately want to - its just that necklaces and bracelets are a lot easier for me to deal with. Not to mention that the headpins I got are a very thin gauge and don't sync up with my eyepins. So once I start selling more necklaces and bracelets, or if I 've had more time to work with the materials I already have, I'll work on earrings, I guess.<br /><br />

		Finally made one bracelet. I've been playing a lot of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, so it's blue and orange. I also made sure to buy a few more odds and ends so that I have plenty of colors and containers for my beads. Now that I'm not in the middle of midterms and I went to see my boyfriend (who lives 800miles away), I have a bit of a second wind about my life.<br /><br />
Anyway, look forward to that bracelet. I may try to recreate it with a few different beads added, also just to make sure I can. <br /><br />
I do wanna go back to working on earrings. I tried to make some for Valentine's Day and failed miserably. :I

		Uploading the basic content to the site to get everything up and running. Doing some troubleshooting to make sure the colors and everything works. No marchandise as yet, but I have plenty ideas. Hope to get this rolling as soon as possible.<br /><br />
