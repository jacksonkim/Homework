/* CIST2362 - 20790 - Kimberly Jackson - SID: 0332
	Week 9ish, Personalized List Class - 10/30/12

	Description: You will also need to build a driver program that demonstrates the use of all of 
		these methods. NOTE: You can force a destructor call by building a function that creates 
		a list object as a local variable. When the function is called and finishes, the destructor for 
		that local list object will be called.
