/* Test Scores 1 - Pointers test program
	p. 537 - #2

	Description: Program to dynamically allocate an array large enough
		to hold a user-defined number of test scores. Once all the scores
		are entered, the array shoul dbe passed to a function that sorts them
		in ascending order (lowest to highest). Another function should be
		called that calculates the average of all the test scores. It should then
		display the sorted list of scores and averages with the appropriate
		headings. Use pointer notation rather than array notation whenever
		possible.

	Input validation: Do not accept negative numbers for test scores.
		Should probably be in general, though. */
