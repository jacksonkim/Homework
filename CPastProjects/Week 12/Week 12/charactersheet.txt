Idania Stasiette
An average girl, not noticeable even when she's standing next to you. 
(Much like Tim.) She has long dirty blonde hair bleached by the constant 
sunlight in the Scorpion kingdom, but later in the story is darkens from 
the lack of constant sunlight to a burgandy? Due to her need to work and 
perform chores and other things, she keeps her hair up in pigtail loops at 
the back of her head. Nothing too fancy so it can be readjusted as necessary. 
Her eyes are maroon in color with golden flecks, making them appear almost 
purple. Her breasts are smaller than average, but her rump is pleasantly plump.

Pink tail. Or kinda lavendar.

Welcome to the dungeon.
