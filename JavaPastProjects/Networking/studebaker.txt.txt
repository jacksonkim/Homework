Albert:
Tonight the streets are red,
the lights are blue and blinding.
No sign of the "Good Doctor,"
but the siren's wail and whining
Tell us he'll be found.

He made his way to the window overlooking the city.

I can almost hear the hounds...

He turned back to the reporters.

What kind of man builds a machine to kill a girl?
No he did not use his hands.
Like a smart man he used a tool.
But just the same,
How can you question who's to blame?

Reporters:
What was her name?

Albert:
It doesn't matter.
Now listen...
"The Good Doctor" has to pay! 

When I say he was a monster,
when I set fire to his name,
It does not matter where you hear it from,
whether truth or lies,
It gets said all the same.

Whatever's on the table plays!

There is a flame I have been fanning.
There is a fire waiting to catch.
There is a hell that has been building
from the moment we first met.

If there ever was a time,
If there ever was a chance,
To undo the things I've done
and wash these bloodstains from my hands,

It has passed and been forgotten.
These are the paths that we must take.
Cause you and I, Tom, we are men 
And we can bend and we can break.

If you think that you can run,
If you think that you can stand,
Well you forget who turned this city on. 
You forget who plugged this city in!

They'll not switch it off again.

One by one they're tuning in.
