Write a program that keeps asking user to enter employee 
contact information (first name, last name, phone number, age) 
until the user chooses 'no' to stop the program. Each round 
of input provided by the user needs to be stored in a database 
(use Derby). Add an ID_number field when storing each new 
employee record in the database. The ID_number field starts 
at 1 and increment by 1 each time a new employee is added 
(use Java code logic to accomplish this instead of setting 
unique constraint and auto increment when creating the table - 
Constraint and auto increment topics may be introduced in 
future assignments). Check each input to make sure that the 
combination of first and last name cannot be stored in the 
database twice. When the user chooses to stop the program. 
The program should retrieve all employee records from 
database and display that report/list on the screen.

* Use the database structure requirements below so 
your source code can be tested using your instructor's database setup for grading purpose.

Database name: EmployeeDB

Table name: Employee

Table fields: ID_number - int, firstName - varchar(20), lastName - varchar(20), phoneNumber - varchar(10), age - int
