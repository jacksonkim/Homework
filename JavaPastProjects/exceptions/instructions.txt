Write a program with the following requirements:

1. ask the user to enter an integer. Then display what the user entered back on the screen if the user entered an integer ("you entered ..."). If the user enter something other than an integer then display on the screen a message that says "you did not enter an integer". 

2. next, the program asks the user to enter a string and displays back on the screen the string that the user entered ("you entered ...". If the data entered is not a string, then display a message that says "you did not enter a string" by generating (throwing) an exception. 

To check if a string variable called myString is a string or not, use this statement:

myString.matches("^[-+]?\\d+(\\.\\d+)?$")

It will return true (boolean data type) if the string is numeric and false if it is not numeric.

3. Create a customized Exception type called my MyNumberException that can generate customized messages like "you did not enter an integer" and "you did not enter a string" as output to display to the user of the program.

4. Save these error messages along with the time stamp (when they were generated) in a text file. Put the .txt file in the same directory as the other .java files.

Submit all files together in one submission.
