1. GUI box with 2 textfields to allow user to enter username/password, 
1 button to submit data, 1 button to exit program, and 1 textarea to display data

2. when the program runs, it waits for the user to enter a username and password. 
If the username/password entered matches one of the records in the database, 
then the program will retrieve all usernames and passwords in database and display 
them all in the textarea (sorted by username ascending order).

3. after a valid username/password record has been entered (one that exists in database), 
the program now allows the user to add more username/password records to the database 
and display them all (by refreshing the data in the textarea with new data retrieved 
from the database).

4. but, if an valid username/password record is provided by the user, then the program 
also stores all the invalid username/password records in a .txt file (append) as log 
information that can be used for security enhancement plans in the future. The data stored 
in the .txt file should be readable when open the file (use coma or tab delimiter)

5.Derby database and file setup

Database name - LoginDB
Table name - LoginTB
Fields - u_name, p_word - both should be varchar(20)

Log file set up:
invalid_attempts.txt - put the .txt file in the same directory as all the .java files - 
use relative path instead of absolute (this means no path such as 'c:\\ ...' should be used)
