A library needs to keep track of its books.  Write a class called 
Book to hold information on a book.  Various attributes of a book 
are its title, author(allow up to four authors), ISBN number, 
publisher, copyright date, price, etc.  Include all appropriate 
accessor and mutator methods (get & set).  Include a boolean to 
determine if the book is checked out or available in the library.  
Override the Object methods appropriately (equals, hashCode, toString, 
etc.).  Include a copy constructor along with all appropriate 
constructors.  Include a static member called nBooks which will be 
used to keep up with the total number of instances of Book you have 
in the library.  Write a test program that will create at least 10 
books, copying at least one.

Display the number of books at the beginning of the program (should be zero). 
After each book is created display the total number of instances of 
Book existing at that time. Test checking out books and checking in books. 
Display a list of all the books showing which ones are checked out.  Use the 
equals method to discover and remove the copied book(s) (this can be 
done by setting the variable to be = null; you can also implement/override 
the finalize method to get the garbage collector to take care fo this - 
see textbook for more information).  Add up the total cost of all of the 
books in the library.  At the end display the number of instances of book 
before exiting the test program.
