She saw the first flashes of explosions in the distance from her friend's house.
Her friend and his family had been terrified. But Winona wanted
to know what was happening. She grabbed a jacket and tore
through the streets headed for the destruction. She turned down
alleyways and raced down sidewalks until she tripped on the arm of
one of the street cleaners. She grunted with effort to stand, wincing 
when she felt the sting of her scraped knee. Thats when she heard the shots.
