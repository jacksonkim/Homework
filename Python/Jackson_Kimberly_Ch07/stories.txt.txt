She saw the first flashes of explosions in the distance from her friends house.\n
Her friend and his family had been terrified. But Winona wanted to know what was happening.\n
She grabbed a jacket and tore through the streets headed for the destruction.\n
She turned down alleyways and raced down sidewalks until she tripped on the arm of\n
one of the street cleaners. She grunted with effort to stand, wincing when she\n
felt the sting of her scraped knee. Thats when she heard the shots.
